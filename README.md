# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Search & Forecasting Web App

This is a Streamlit-based web application built as a side project to showcase skills in Python, data visualization, and machine learning. The app is designed for financial analysis and wealth management, allowing users to:

- **Search for Stocks:** Retrieve and display key financial indicators and historical data for any given stock.
- **Forecast Stock Prices:** Experiment with different machine learning models and tuning parameters to forecast future stock prices.

## Features

- **Interactive Stock Dashboard:**  
  - Search for a stock by its symbol (e.g., TSLA).
  - Display key indicators such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
  - Visualize historical price trends using interactive charts.

- **Machine Learning Forecasting:**  
  - Choose from multiple machine learning models for forecasting.
  - Adjust tuning parameters to optimize predictions.
  - Compare forecasted stock prices against historical data.

## Technologies Used
